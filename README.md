The provided code is a simple memory card game implemented in JavaScript.

It starts by defining an array images containing various emojis.

Three important arrays are initialized: cards to hold the generated cards, flippedCards to keep track of selected cards, and matchedPairs to count the number of matched pairs.

The CreateGameBoard function dynamically generates a game board by duplicating the images, shuffling them, creating card elements with event listeners, and appending them to the gameboard element. It also resets the cards array.

When a card is clicked (handleCardClick), it flips the card, adds it to flippedCards, checks for a match, and if two cards are flipped, it calls the checkMatch function after 1 second.

The checkMatch function compares the images on the flipped cards, updates the UI accordingly, increments matchedPairs, and calls showGameOverMessage if all pairs are matched.

The resetGame function clears the gameboard, resets matchedPairs to 0, and calls CreateGameBoard to restart the game.

Finally, the initial game setup is triggered by calling CreateGameBoard.
